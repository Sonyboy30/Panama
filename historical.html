        The dream of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans dates back to the 1500s, when explorers imagined a shortcut
        through the Isthmus of Panama. By the late 19th century, French engineer <strong>Ferdinand de Lesseps</strong>,
        who had successfully built the Suez Canal, attempted to construct a similar sea-level canal in Panama.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the French effort collapsed due to constant landslides, tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever,
        and devastating financial mismanagement. Thousands of workers died, and the project was abandoned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1903, the United States under President <strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong> supported Panama’s independence
        from Colombia and negotiated rights to build and control the canal zone. The American effort would go on to complete
        one of the most ambitious engineering projects in human history by 1914.
