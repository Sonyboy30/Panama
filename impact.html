        The Panama Canal’s construction not only transformed global trade but also reshaped the
        social and political landscape of Panama. Thousands of workers from the Caribbean,
        Central America, and Europe came to the isthmus seeking work — many recruited through
        U.S. agencies and labor contractors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Labor was organized through a rigid two-tier system known as the 
        <strong>“Gold Roll”</strong> and <strong>“Silver Roll.”</strong> White American
        workers were placed on the Gold Roll, receiving higher wages, better housing, and
        privileges. Nonwhite laborers — largely West Indian and Latin American men — were
        placed on the Silver Roll, facing lower pay, inferior housing, and segregated facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite harsh conditions and discrimination, West Indian workers formed the backbone
        of the project. Their endurance under brutal heat and disease was essential to
        the canal’s completion, yet their contributions were often overlooked in early
        American narratives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Politically, the 1903 <strong>Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty</strong> granted the U.S.
        permanent control of the Canal Zone — a decision deeply resented in Panama.
        For decades, U.S. flags, schools, and police operated inside the zone as if it
        were American territory. Tensions over sovereignty persisted throughout the
        20th century until treaties in the 1970s paved the way for Panama to regain full
        control in 1999.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Panama Canal thus reflects not only a triumph of engineering but also a
        complex story of <strong>imperialism, labor inequality, and resilience.</strong>
