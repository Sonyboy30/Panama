    <section>
      <p>
        Completed in <strong>1914</strong>, the Panama Canal revolutionized global trade by 
        providing a direct maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 
        It became one of the most critical transportation corridors in the world, 
        connecting over <strong>160 countries</strong> and <strong>1,700 ports</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond engineering, the Canal symbolized a new era of U.S. influence. 
        Its construction demonstrated America’s growing role as a global power and 
        highlighted the intersection of innovation, diplomacy, and imperial ambition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, the Canal evolved into a shared symbol of both achievement and inequality. 
        For Panama, it represented both opportunity and the struggle for sovereignty. 
        In <strong>1977</strong>, the <em>Torrijos–Carter Treaties</em> set the process for 
        transferring control to Panama, which was completed on <strong>December 31, 1999</strong>. 
        This historic handover marked a new chapter in Panamanian independence and pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the <strong>Panama Canal Authority</strong> manages the waterway as a national asset. 
        Expansion projects completed in 2016 allow massive “New Panamax” ships to pass, 
        reaffirming the canal’s central role in 21st-century trade and sustainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than a century after its completion, the Panama Canal endures as a 
        <strong>monument to global cooperation and human perseverance</strong> — a 
        powerful reminder of how vision and determination can reshape the world.
